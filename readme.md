# Work Day Scheduler

## Description
This work day scheduler allows users to schedule their work day events on an hourly basis from 9AM to 5PM. 

The planner does the following:
  * Allows users to enter events for every hour starting at 9PM and ending at 5PM.
  * The time blocks are color coded to indicate past, present or future events.
  * When a user clicks the save icon, it will save upcoming events in the users local storage. 
  * The event will persist even when the page is refreshed.
